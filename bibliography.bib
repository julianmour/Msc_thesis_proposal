abstract = {We address the problem of synthesizing code completions for programs using APIs. Given a program with holes, we synthesize completions for holes with the most likely sequences of method calls.Our main idea is to reduce the problem of code completion to a natural-language processing problem of predicting probabilities of sentences. We design a simple and scalable static analysis that extracts sequences of method calls from a large codebase, and index these into a statistical language model. We then employ the language model to find the highest ranked sentences, and use them to synthesize a code completion. Our approach is able to synthesize sequences of calls across multiple objects together with their arguments.Experiments show that our approach is fast and effective. Virtually all computed completions typecheck, and the desired completion appears in the top 3 results in 90% of the cases.},

abstract = {Given an instruction set, the superoptimizer finds the shortest program to compute a function. Startling programs have been generated, many of them engaging in convoluted bit-fiddling bearing little resemblance to the source programs which defined the functions. The key idea in the superoptimizer is a probabilistic test that makes exhaustive searches practical for programs of useful size. The search space is defined by the processor's instruction set, which may include the whole set, but it is typically restricted to a subset. By constraining the instructions and observing the effect on the output program, one can gain insight into the design of instruction sets. In addition, superoptimized programs may be used by peephole optimizers to improve the quality of generated code, or by assembly language programmers to improve manually written code.},
