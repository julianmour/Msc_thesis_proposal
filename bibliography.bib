abstract = {We address the problem of synthesizing code completions for programs using APIs. Given a program with holes, we synthesize completions for holes with the most likely sequences of method calls.Our main idea is to reduce the problem of code completion to a natural-language processing problem of predicting probabilities of sentences. We design a simple and scalable static analysis that extracts sequences of method calls from a large codebase, and index these into a statistical language model. We then employ the language model to find the highest ranked sentences, and use them to synthesize a code completion. Our approach is able to synthesize sequences of calls across multiple objects together with their arguments.Experiments show that our approach is fast and effective. Virtually all computed completions typecheck, and the desired completion appears in the top 3 results in 90% of the cases.},

abstract = {Given an instruction set, the superoptimizer finds the shortest program to compute a function. Startling programs have been generated, many of them engaging in convoluted bit-fiddling bearing little resemblance to the source programs which defined the functions. The key idea in the superoptimizer is a probabilistic test that makes exhaustive searches practical for programs of useful size. The search space is defined by the processor's instruction set, which may include the whole set, but it is typically restricted to a subset. By constraining the instructions and observing the effect on the output program, one can gain insight into the design of instruction sets. In addition, superoptimized programs may be used by peephole optimizers to improve the quality of generated code, or by assembly language programmers to improve manually written code.},

    abstractNote={Evasion attack in multi-label learning systems is an interesting, widely witnessed, yet rarely explored research topic. Characterizing the crucial factors determining the attackability of the multi-label adversarial threat is the key to interpret the origin of the adversarial vulnerability and to understand how to mitigate it. Our study is inspired by the theory of adversarial risk bound. We associate the attackability of a targeted multi-label classifier with the regularity of the classifier and the training data distribution. Beyond the theoretical attackability analysis, we further propose an efficient empirical attackability estimator via greedy label space exploration. It provides provably computational efficiency and approximation accuracy. Substantial experimental results on real-world datasets validate the unveiled attackability factors and the effectiveness of the proposed empirical attackability indicator.},

abstract="Deep neural networks have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks that perturb inputs based on semantic features. Existing robustness analyzers can reason about semantic feature neighborhoods to increase the networks' reliability. However, despite the significant progress in these techniques, they still struggle to scale to deep networks and large neighborhoods. In this work, we introduce VeeP, an active learning approach that splits the verification process into a series of smaller verification steps, each is submitted to an existing robustness analyzer. The key idea is to build on prior steps to predict the next optimal step. The optimal step is predicted by estimating the robustness analyzer's velocity and sensitivity via parametric regression. We evaluate VeeP on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet and show that it can analyze neighborhoods of various features: brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, and lightness. We show that, on average, given a 90 minute timeout, VeeP verifies 96{\%} of the maximally certifiable neighborhoods within 29 minutes, while existing splitting approaches verify, on average, 73{\%} of the maximally certifiable neighborhoods within 58 minutes.",

  abstract = 	 {This work studies the robustness certification problem of neural network models, which aims to find certified adversary-free regions as large as possible around data points. In contrast to the existing approaches that seek regions bounded uniformly along all input features, we consider non-uniform bounds and use it to study the decision boundary of neural network models. We formulate our target as an optimization problem with nonlinear constraints. Then, a framework applicable for general feedforward neural networks is proposed to bound the output logits so that the relaxed problem can be solved by the augmented Lagrangian method. Our experiments show the non-uniform bounds have larger volumes than uniform ones. Compared with normal models, the robust models have even larger non-uniform bounds and better interpretability. Further, the geometric similarity of the non-uniform bounds gives a quantitative, data-agnostic metric of input featuresâ€™ robustness.}
